This repository contains four Python Source Files, a IPYNB (Jupiter Notebook) file, and a .png file. The project is a regression task project where various environmental factors are used to predict the Standard yield of crops on fields where they are planted. The python source files has to be downloaded in the same file path as the notebook to successfully run code cells in the notebook, the .py files are modules referenced in the notebook.  
The notebook contains an integrated project aimed at testing my knowledge of making predictions with regression tasks and using metrics to compare the robustness of different models, particularly in terms of model selection.
